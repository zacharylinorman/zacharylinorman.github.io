## About Me
I am a *highly* motivated ~~self-learner~~ autodidact who **loves** computer science. I have been a software developer for **nearly _ten years_**, and hope to take the next step to become a qualified ***software engineer*** in the near future.

In the words of Albert Einstein:
>Once we accept our limits, we go beyond them.

### Projects

### Background
My computer science journey started with the combination of the video game [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us) and a single line of code: `System.out.println("Hello World!");`. Minecraft, which is developed in Java, allowed for developers to create their own mods for the game. I became very interested in this, and thus my journey began.

### Interests
I have many other interests outside of the world of computer science. I enjoy 
- playing video games
- watching anime
- listening to audio books
- practicing the piano
- training in Shaolin Kung Fu
